# Image_Recognition__ML
This project focuses on building an image recognition model in Python using deep learning techniques. I explored fundamental concepts of image classification and developed practical skills in training, evaluating, and optimizing models. The work culminated in creating a deployable solution capable of accurately classifying images.

Key features include:

- Data preprocessing and augmentation for improved model performance.
- Implementation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- Model training and evaluation using standard datasets.
- Deployment-ready pipeline for real-world use cases.

This repository serves as a practical demonstration of applying deep learning to solve computer vision problems from start to finish.
