# Image_Recognition__ML
This project focuses on building an image recognition model in Python using deep learning techniques. I explored fundamental concepts of image classification and developed practical skills in training, evaluating, and optimizing models. The work culminated in creating a deployable solution capable of accurately classifying images.
